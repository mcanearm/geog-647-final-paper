The purpose of this research is to investigate the Milwaukee Streetcar as a transit-oriented development strategy, the distribution of benefits and burdens, and its implications for equitable development. Guided by semi-structured interviews and content/discourse analysis of planning/policy documents through an equity lens, this study analyzed Milwaukee’s initial downtown streetcar routes against the potential extension lines into the more transit-dependent communities of Bronzeville and Walker’s Point. The findings suggest that the initial routes and possible extension lines were engaged in very different political and planning processes, the latter of which employed explicit attention to equitable development. While certain tools have been identified to address concerns of displacement resulting from transit-oriented development, there continues to be several barriers to overcome to achieve equitable development.},

	abstract = {In the past decade, streetcars dramatically increased in popularity with high expectations for stimulating economic development in the aftermath of the recent recession. Since 2009, 14 streetcar projects began construction in large and mid-sized cities and received over \$500 million in federal funding. But the actual development impacts of these new streetcar projects are not well understood or studied. The academic literature on the impacts of streetcar systems is nearly non-existent and most of the expectations for streetcars are based on the experiences of lines in Portland and Seattle. Given the substantial amount of investment from localities and the federal government, great expectations for new development, and wide array of cities attempting to construct streetcar systems, the economic development impact of streetcars is important to study and understand. This study found: • Many cities base their economic development projections either on the experiences of transit-oriented development on other types of rail, like heavy rail, which may have different development potential or they are based on the experiences of Portland and Seattle, which may have different planning and development environments from other cities. • Federal agencies award streetcar projects primarily on a qualitative analysis that contains very little quantitative rigor or analysis. Furthermore, federal officials do not distinguish between different transit modes when it comes to potential development impacts, despite research showing varying levels of development from different modes. The development impacts promised by these projects are left largely unchallenged and, instead, cities create narratives of the transformative effects streetcars may have for their communities. • Some streetcar corridors do see substantial growth in development, but not all. Using property values to demonstrate economic development progress, I measured development impacts for recent streetcar lines in Tucson and Atlanta. Tucson demonstrated the largest impact in property values with an over 75\% increase in value from two years before the streetcar announcement to 2014. This increase is impressive compared to another corridor in downtown Tucson, which actually saw a slight decline in property values, overall. The Atlanta streetcar corridor, though, saw no increases in property values and saw a significant decline in value that corresponds to the same decline most of the city experienced during the recession. And compared to a comparable corridor in the city, the streetcar corridor did not demonstrate substantially fewer losses in property value. Atlanta illustrates that streetcar investments alone do not stimulate development. • Using Tucson and Atlanta, along with Portland and Seattle, I found a number of other factors that may contribute to streetcar corridor development. Existing and growing real estate demand, large property owners, zoning, tax incentives, and other related investments in infrastructure are all necessary components of stimulating economic development in streetcar corridors. Additional data analysis in Tucson found that the streetcar corridor was already seeing large increases in property values prior to the construction of the streetcar. • More robust metrics and analysis of streetcar corridors are necessary for communities and the federal government to better understand the potential development impacts of these projects and weigh their costs and benefits. Furthermore, communities should understand that streetcars likely will not stimulate development without the presence of other investments and factors.},

	abstract = {In 1916, a national planning expert strongly advised Milwaukee city and county planners to integrate electric railway transit into any comprehensive metropolitan plan. In that same year, a great proponent of publicly owned transit, socialist Daniel W. Hoan, became mayor of Milwaukee. Twelve years later—while Hoan was still mayor—a national engineering firm made the same recommendation. During the interim, however, it became apparent to city leaders, including Hoan, that they did not have either the legal or financial tools necessary to effectively implement any plan that involved altering and improving transit routes and service. Although Wisconsin adopted municipal “home rule” in 1924, the provision was in reality “too little too late” in that it did not grant cities authority to take over the privately owned for-profit transit companies holding monopolies over their streets. Nor was an option to establish a regional transit authority available until after World War II. This article explores the intersecting roles of state laws, the Wisconsin Railroad Commission, local elected leaders, and appointed planners in the ultimate—automobile-dependent—result.},

	abstract = {During the 1970s, an era of increasing fiscal austerity and deindustrialization, cities across the United States sought to arrest the spread of urban disinvestment. In 1974, faced with similar concerns, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, implemented a two-part planning programme. First, planners conducted the Relative Residential Status (RRS) evaluation to assess, classify, and map neighbourhood health. The RRS map delineated three types of neighbourhoods: healthy, threatened but savable, and unsavable. Second, Preservation Planning prescribed policies and resources based on the RRS neighbourhood types, concentrating resources in the neighbourhoods classified as threatened but savable. The paper examines the implementation of RRS and Preservation Planning. I argue that RRS/Preservation Planning functioned as urban triage by seeking to bolster the housing market in moderately healthy, white neighbourhoods as it prescribed market-determined, inevitable death for less healthy, African-American neighbourhoods. The main point supporting this argument is that planners borrowed and recalibrated RRS/Preservation Planning to officially and systematically redline neighbourhoods that would have been judged savable in other US cities. In doing so, this form of urban triage exacerbated urban decline and racial injustice instead of arresting the spread of urban disinvestment.},

	abstract = {Many communities in the United States have been adding new light rail to bus-predominant public transit systems. However, there is disagreement as to whether opening light rail lines attracts new ridership or merely draws ridership from existing transit users. We study a new light rail line in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, which is part of a complete street redevelopment. We utilize a pre-test post-test control group quasi-experimental design to test two different measures of ridership change. The first measure is calculated from stops along the light rail route; the second assumes that nearby bus stops might be displaced by the rail and calculates ridership change with those stops included as baseline. Both the simple measure (transit use changes on the complete street light rail corridor) and the “displacement” measure (transit use changes in the one-quarter mile catchment areas around new light rail stops) showed significant (p {\textless} .01) and substantial (677\%) increases in transit passengers compared to pre-light rail bus users. In particular, the displacement analysis discredits a common challenge that when a new light rail line opens, most passengers are simply former bus riders whose routes were canceled in favor of light rail. The study suggests that light rail services can attract additional ridership to public transit systems. In addition, although pre-post control-group designs require time and effort, this project underscores the benefits of such quasi-experimental designs in terms of the strength of the inferences that can be drawn about the impacts of new transit infrastructure and services.},
